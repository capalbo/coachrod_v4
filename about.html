    <p class="lead">About CoachRod</p>
    <p>The fact that Rodrigo Porto, the founder and President of CoachRod, is a successful newcomer to Canada himself differentiates his coaching practice from your usual career coach and immigrant counselor. Rodrigo landed in Vancouver, Canada - 2011 after only 7 months of having applied to his permanent resident visa and successfully transitioned his HR and T&D career to Canada. Within less than 2 months of his arrival Rod was already interviewing with 2 of the top 50 employers in British Columbia, resulting in a job offer from the Sauder School of Business, UBC within 3 months of his arrival, where he now advises and prepares the MBA students of a Top 100 B-school for their future careers.<div id="portrait"><img class="pic" src="img/rod.jpg" width="229" height="315" align="right" /></div>

<p>Prior to that, Rodrigo was the Latin America HR and Training & Development Manager for Samsung HQ located out of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Recruited to start-up a Latin America-wide T&D program, in a very short amount of time, Rodrigo built a business case and support for Training and Development, negotiated a $1M T&D budget, implemented 50 e-Learning programs, led succession planning and talent development programs, developed T&D benchmarks across global operations and advised on compensation and benefit policies.</p> 

<p>Prior to Samsung, Rodrigo's experience was in progressively larger ESL companies through acquisition, beginning with his own start-up at age 18, which was acquired, then taking on multi-branch management responsibility, then company-wide HR responsibility, and again through acquisition, finally working for the largest provider of language teaching and vocational education as a Regional HR and T&D Manager. Rodrigo possesses excellent business acumen, is very service oriented and has the unique advantage of understanding the difficulties of being a newcomer to Canada. Currently an active member of Career Professionals of Canada, MBA Career Services Council, BC HRMA, BC ODN - CoachRod assists talented newcomers to Canada on leading their careers with passion and utmost success.
